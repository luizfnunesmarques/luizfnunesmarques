### Hi, I'm Luiz ðŸ‘‹. 
Pronounced initially /Ëˆlwis/, but any given form works ðŸ˜„.

I currently work with all things cloud and infrastructure. Think .tf, .yaml, .conf, .toml, .service, etc.

I'm a very hands-on engineer and I love to architect **and** deploy things.

ðŸ”­  On my last projects I've been a mix of Infrastructure/Cloud/SRE positions, working on:

- Managing Kubernetes clusters from writing terraform for the infrastructure to "coding" manifests/Helm/Kustomize for the actual workloads.
- Writing terraform to manage infrastructure on AWS, mainly around optimal computing for given workloads, network design and access management. 
- Debugging live environments to find&fix issues, when causes vary from wrong dns resolution on a nginx module to over capacity enis. AWS be like ðŸ¤·.
- Architecting cloud infrastructure from scratch for new projects, from network (vpc, subnets, etc) design to computing (ðŸ’°) to databases (ðŸ’¸). The list goes on.
- Deploying and managing secrets management solutions around Hashicorp's Vault.

âš¡ Fun fact: I do drinks! As a Brazilian born guy, I can only be picky about the proper method of making a [caipirinha](https://iba-world.com/caipirinha/). ~Please don't shake it off.~

âš¡ Fun fact 2: I'm a computer networks geek. From tcp to dns to bgp to cidr blocks, I like it.

âš¡ Fun fact 3: I've worked as a backend engineer before moving to cloud things. I worked in projects at big corps with Java/Pascal/c# to Ruby/Python in fast growing startups. I have plenty of good memories working for both: good product == employee hapiness.
